          Hi! I'm a rising third-year mathematics undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am fortunate to work with Prof. <a href="https://amirmohan.github.io/" target="_blank">Amirali Aghazadeh</a>. Briefly, my research interests are in theoretical machine learning and optimal transport. Outside of academics, I enjoy <a href="https://goodreads.com/chenthan" target="_blank">reading</a> and bouldering. This summer, I am participating in a REU at Williams College.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          My primary research interests are in the algorithmic and theoretical foundations of diffusion models on general Riemannian manifolds, particularly on Lie groups. My work leverages techniques from optimal transport, differential geometry, and high-dimensional statistics. I am also interested in accelerating sampling for discrete diffusion models for structured data, such as sequences and natural language, with applications to protein modeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my research threads can be summarized as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Main goal:</strong> Given samples \(\{\mathbf{z}^i\}\) drawn from an unknown data distribution \(\rho(\mathbf{z})\), we want to build a generative model that learns to map samples from a simple reference distribution \(\rho_0\) (e.g., a Gaussian) to the complex data distribution \(\rho\).
          This task combines the structure of Optimal Transport with the flexibility of Normalizing Flows. Brenier's theorem suggests that we should search for maps that are gradients of convex functions. This is a powerful structural prior that can lead to more stable and interpretable models than a generic neural network.
        </p>
        <p>
          My other interests include NLP research, applied machine learning, and AI interpretability.
