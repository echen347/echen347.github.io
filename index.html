          Hi! I'm a rising third-year mathematics undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My research interests include differential geometry, manifold diffusion, and machine learning. I am fortunate to work with Prof. <a href="https://amirmohan.github.io/" target="_blank">Amirali Aghazadeh</a> at Georgia Tech. Outside of math, I enjoy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/notaprimelens/" target="_blank">photography</a> and bouldering. This summer, I am participating in a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at Williams College.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          My research spans several areas within mathematics and machine learning. I investigate the algorithmic and theoretical foundations of diffusion models on general Riemannian manifolds, with an emphasis on applications to Lie groups, by employing advanced techniques from optimal transport and differential geometry. I also develop and implement discrete diffusion models for structured data, such as sequences and natural language, with applications to protein modeling. This includes engineering novel predictor-corrector sampling strategies inspired by k-Gillespie methods to enhance convergence and generation quality. 
          <br><br>
          In differential geometry, I work on advancing research on the Cartanâ€“Hadamard conjecture in CAT(0) spaces by developing novel techniques to analyze curvature bounds in non-smooth metric spaces. My experience also includes NLP research, where I engineered robust data pipelines for large-scale T5 model training and co-authored research on optimizing transformer fine-tuning, achieving significant BLEU score improvements through novel attention mechanism modifications. Additionally, I apply machine learning in practical settings, such as optimizing vehicle performance for HyTech Racing (Formula SAE) and designing olympiad-level math problems for LLM training at Scale AI.
