# Personal Academic Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal academic website, available at [echen347.github.io](https://echen347.github.io).

## Overview

The website is built with plain HTML and styled with [LaTeX.css](https://latex.vercel.app/) for a clean, academic look. It consists of the following pages:

-   `index.html`: The main page, containing my bio, research interests, and contact information.
-   `writing.html`: A page featuring my posts from Substack.
-   `photography.html`: A simple gallery for my photography.

## Development

The site is intentionally simple and lightweight. It uses a single stylesheet and does not require a build step.

### Math Rendering

Mathematical notation is rendered using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/). You can write LaTeX math inside `\( ... \)` for inline math and `$$ ... $$` for display math.

## Deployment

This site is automatically deployed via GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
